Description: 1. The significance tests are based on the type of confidence intervals chosen. 2. Missing values are handled with full-information maximum likelihood. 3. No cross-loading or correlated indicator residuals is allowed. 4. Second-order factors should be defined after all first-order factors in the model. 5. For second-order factor, omegaT shows the overall reliability of the first-order factors, omegaH shows the reliability of the second-order factor. 6. Before generating the outputs, bootstrapped samples with improper solutions (non-convergence, negative variance, and correlation greater than 1) are removed.
